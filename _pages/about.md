Hello there! Welcome to my website.

I'm a Master's student in Materials Science at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Madras,  where I spend my days exploring the fascinating world of computational materials science. My passion lies in using first principles-based materials modeling and design to understand and create new materials with unique properties.

I'm currently knee-deep in atomistic modeling of entropy stabilized refractory alloys under [Dr. Satyesh Kumar Yadav](https://mme.iitm.ac.in/satyesh/bio.html), but my interests don't stop there. I love to learn new things, whether it's web design, automating workflows with Python, shell and C++ or simply immersing myself in the beauty of nature.

When I'm not busy cracking the code of materials science, you can find me sketching with pen, getting lost in the world of Kdramas, or indulging my insatiable appetite for knowledge. I truly believe that science and creativity go hand-in-hand, and I'm always on the lookout for new and exciting ways to merge these two worlds.

So that's a little bit about me. I hope you'll join me on this journey of discovery, where we'll explore the wonders of materials science and the world around us!
